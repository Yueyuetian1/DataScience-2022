## HW1 Background
*Ernest Hemingway on Writing* is an excellent work of Hemingway. In order to create one data visualization about Hemingway text, I drew a word cloud diagram about *Ernest Hemingway on Writing*, as shown in the figure below.

Some words appear very frequently in the book, but they do not well represent the main contents of the book, such as "he", "you" and "I". These common words are deleted as stop words.

After deleting the stop words, the word frequency was counted and the word cloud diagram of *Ernest Hemingway on Writing* was drawn.As can be seen from the word cloud diagram, the three main keywords of this book are: "write", "writing" and "good".This is also in line with the real theme of the book: **writing**. 

On the other hand, it can be seen that the names in this book do not appear frequently, indicating that this book is not a novel or biography.If you want to find the key words and topics of a book or a paragraph of text quickly, you can draw a word cloud diagram.
